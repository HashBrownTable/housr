Have you ever struggled with finding roommates when you first moved into a new city? How about finding the perfect place, but can't afford it unless you share the cost with someone... Are you a single parent, struggling to find a housing partner as an  affordable option for your family? Are you a student, low income and in debt, trying to make ends meet...

To address these problems, we have envisioned a roommate finding solution -- Housr. 

#What is Housr?
Housr is a roommate finding service that help match you up with potential roommates. 

## How to use
When you sign up, we will ask you a little bit about yourself, such as your desired price range for rental, and then help you find some potential roommates who matched your preference.

To address the barrier in communication and facilitate micro conversations, we have a chat platform that allows you to chat with people you would like to potentially live with and get to know better.
